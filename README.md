# FullAdder
A full adder is a binary circuit with 3 inputs (A, B, Cin) and 2 outputs (Sum, Cout). It includes a carry input, handling carry from prior stages. The truth table shows its inclusive operation. Logic equations for Sum (S) and carry-out (Cout) involve XOR and AND gates. Crucial for multi-bit addition, it's a key component in digital systems.
